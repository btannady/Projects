A list of some of my significant projects.


<h2 id="food-quest">"Food Quest" | Virtual Reality RPG</h2>
Created for the Nutrition XR division at UCSD's Virtual/Augmented Reality organization. Seven person project team. 
<br />
Created using Unity3D, Blender, and SteamVR. The concept behind the game is to promote healthy eating through interactive yet educational gameplay. Players are sent on dangerous quests and adventures to go hunting for food monsters in a fictional VR environment. After collecting enough food ingredients to complete a recipe, players will then return to the village kitchen to manually cook all of their collected ingredients to prepare a healthy dish.
<br />
<br />
The project involved the use of Unity3D as the gaming engine to run C# code. Along with this, I primarily focused on creating the 3D graphic models and assets within the Food Quest game. Our team had a lot of fun showcasing our project development in several UC San Diego hosted exhibitions.

<h2 id="garden-app">"Garden App" | Plant Maintenance Web Application</h2>
A simple and clean web application that provides users, new and old to gardening, an easy platform to help them care for their plants. Created as three person project team in UI/UX Interaction Design.
<br />
<br /> 
Without the direct guidance of a local gardening community or extensive online research, it is difficult and time consuming to find the resources and knowledge a novice gardener needs in order to care for their garden in their local environment. 
Some of the features in our app included a way to search through catalogs of different plants in our database, where users would be able to quickly discover important ‘need to know’ information regarding each specific plant. Additionally, we also included a personalized plant calendar in the app to help users keep track of watering days. 
<br />
<br />
Made with HTML/CSS, Node.js, and Adobe XD.

<h2 id="pokedex">"Sinnoh Region Pokedex" | Pokemon Database Search Simulator</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/btannady/SinnohRegionPokedex
<br />
<br />
Created independently for a python course final project. This program contains a built-in database of every single pokemon from the Sinnoh Region. Users are able to quickly and swiftly parse through detailed information on different pokemon within the database.


<h2 id="server up!">"Server Up!" | Customer Traffic-Flow Simulator</h2>
Repository: https://github.com/btannady/CustomerServiceSimulator
<br />
<br />
An independent programming project that utilizes the Poisson distribution model to systematically operate a minute-by-minute customer traffic-flow simulation.
<br />
<br />
Entities are visually displayed to represent the individual customers waiting in queue and being helped by available servers.
<br />
<br />
Made with C++.
